# Lab1

## Task 1

This task takes in a sentence and splits the sentence into individual texts

For example:

> Computer Science is fun to learn

Output:

> Computer

> science

> is

> fun

> to

> learn

## Task 2
This task entails editing the rules on the flex input file by specifying our own rules.

For example:

> He is a smart boy

Output:

> He

> is

> a

> smart

> boy

> Number of words: 5

> Number of spaces: 4

> Number of vowels: 5

> Number of consonants: 8

The resultant lexer reads the input text and tokenizes it into words and spaces. It then counts the number of words, spaces, vowels and consonants. It then prints out the results at the end of the analysis.
